        <h1>Last Wish Raid Guide</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Last Wish, the penultimate chapter in your efforts throughout Forsaken. Your objective is simple. Kill Riven, a Taken Ahamkara dwelling within
            the Dreaming City. She is responsible for bending Uldren Sov's will, in a (successful) effort to open the gate to Dreaming City. She is also responsible
            for corrupting the city itself.

                <p>The raid has a recommended light level of 550, but every encounter is 560 or higher. This means the ideal light level is whatever you can manage.
                    Additionally, most raid clears will make use of a few pieces of gear that may as well be considered mandatory for all but the most experienced fireteams.
                </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>The first encounter you face pits you against Kalli, one of Queen Mara's techeuns.</p>
                        <h3>Light Level</h3>
                        <p>560</p>
                        <h3>Objective</h3>
                        <p>Free Kalli from Taken influence. This is done by depleting her health bar, weakening her and allowing her to overcome the Taken influence.</p>
                        <h3>Room Layout</h3>
                        <p>The encounter takes place in a large room, split into three sections by three paths that run from the center.
                            In the center is a pit where you will initially see Kalli. Lining the pit are three sets of doors that will be important later.
                            Above each set of doors will be a pillar hanging from the ceiling, with two of the same symbol on each side.
                            Scattered around the room are nine large plates, each with a symbol above them. Each plate is divided into three sections.
                            Each symbol from the center will be above one of the plates, totalling six plates. The other three plates will have a fourth symbol above them that
                            is not present in the center.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Kalli is never immune, but she does have a very large health pool. Sustained damage will be necessary to succeed.</li>
                            <li>When the encounter starts, either by shooting Kalli or by stepping on a plate, each plate will have two of the three sections on it taken up
                                by a ball of Taken energy. After a few seconds, the ball will discharge, killing anyone standing on that section of the plate. The third section
                                is safe to stand on.
                            </li>
                            <li>Standing on a plate for three or four cycles (a Taken ball discharging is one cycle) will spawn a Knight on front of the plate. Kill it, and you will
                                clear that plate. This will be indicated by no more Taken balls spawning on that plate, as well as a corresponding symbol disappearing from the center.
                            </li>
                            <li>Each symbol stationed above the doors corresponds to one of the two rows of doors below it. Clearing the symbol "unlocks" that row of doors.</li>
                            <li>Kalli will teleport to plates largely at random (though she can be coerced onto a specific plate), and attack the player there with an attack that propels
                                you into the air, and another that knocks you back. Take care not to let those attacks knock you into a section of the plate covered by the Taken ball.
                                She can be damaged, and enough damage will cause her to leave before executing her second attack.
                            </li>
                            <li>After a set period of time, usually just enough time to clear a plate, Kalli will teleport to the center, and stand under one of the hanging pillars.
                                This is indicated by text, "Kalli conceives an ontological weapon". She will attack you with ranged attacks, as well as a stomp, but she will be more or
                                less stationary, giving you time to damage her.
                            </li>
                            <li>After a short period of time, text will appear, "Kalli prepares to wield her weapon". This signals that she is preparing to wipe your fireteam.
                                After a brief channeling period, during which she can still be damaged, but cannot be staggered, everyone not in a safe room dies.
                            </li>
                            <li>A couple seconds after Kalli begins to channel her wipe mechanic, six of the doors below her will open, at random. Being in the small room behind it
                                will allow you to survive the wipe. Each door can only have one person in it. If two people enter the room, then the room no longer grants safety.
                                Same thing happens if a player enters the room then leaves it. This means everyone needs to quickly enter their own room.
                            </li>
                            <li>If you survive the wipe mechanic, Kalli will teleport under another pillar (above another set of doors), and repeat the wipe channeling after a short delay.</li>
                            <li>After Kalli performs the wipe mechanic three times (once for each set of doors), she will teleport away. The symbols above the doors will reappear,
                                the plates will refresh, and the encounter essentially repeats itself. Important to note: the symbols may be different from before, so get your bearings
                                and determine which symbols are present again.
                            </li>
                            <li>You can clear a plate with the incorrect symbol, however doing so wastes time and spawns a 580 Ogre in the center. Don't do it.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Strategy</h3>
                        <p>There are two distinct strategies for this encounter. One is the way most fireteams will accomplish it, and another is primarily for those
                            looking to complete the encounter as quickly as possible.
                        </p>
                        <div class="dropdown">
                            <div><h4>Normal Method</h4></div>
                            <div>
                                <h3>Loadouts</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>One or two warlocks with Well of Radiance</li>
                                    <li>One or two titans with Hammer Strike</li>
                                    <li>One or two nightstalkers</li>
                                    <li>Everyone should have their ranged DPS weapon of choice equipped</li>
                                    <li>IKELOS or your shotgun of choice is helpful for killing Knights</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Before the encounter starts, assign plates. This can be done formally (one way is to physically stand under the symbol you want to help with)
                                    or informally (determine which symbol is missing, then just go to a plate that doesn't have that symbol). One person stands near each plate,
                                    then on a countdown, everyone steps on their plate and starts clearing it. Manage the thralls that will approach you on your plate,
                                    and just make sure you don't die. Once your Knight spawns, kill it, then assist your fireteam as necessary.
                                </p>
                                <p>Once Kalli teleports to the center, everyone moves to the center of the pit, a Well is placed, and you begin DPSing Kalli however you're comfortable.
                                    Whisper is typically the best option, as the infinite ammo if you aim properly is exceptionally useful, and on its own it has one of the highest
                                    DPS in the game. Meanwhile, your titan should Hammer Strike Kalli, before joining the rest of the team for DPS.
                                    Once the doors open, figure out how you will assign doors. One common method is to, before the encounter, assign every player a number 1-6.
                                    When the doors open, you go to the door specified by your number. Do so by counting open doors, left to right, until you reach the door with your number.
                                    Another riskier option is to not assign numbers, and instead have two players enter doors at a time. After the wipe, and the doors reopen, one nightstalker
                                    will tether the numerous Psions that have spawned in the center.
                                </p>
                                <p>Repeat until Kalli's health is depleted.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="dropdown">
                            <div><h4>Speedrun Method</h4></div>
                            <div>
                                <p>This method is not recommended unless you're part of a very experienced fireteam that you trust, and it also has much stricter loadout requirements.
                                    If you disagree with the recommended strategy, let me know, but you're probably skilled enough to where you don't need this guide either.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Loadouts</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Two or more warlocks with Well of Radiance and Lunafaction</li>
                                    <li>IKELOS on all six players</li>
                                    <li>Whisper on all six players</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    This strategy ignores most of the mechanics in the encounter, and instead focuses on a couple in particular; the fact that Kalli will teleport to a
                                    random plate that a player is on, and the fact that Kalli is never immune except at the very start. It will also require that your fireteam knows
                                    exactly where Kalli will spawn when she teleports near a plate.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Choose a plate. Have one person stand on the plate while the rest of your fireteam stands in a specific spot based on which weapon they plan on using to DPS
                                    first. If your fireteam is starting with IKELOS, then stand right next to where Kalli will spawn. If you're using Whisper, stand further away, but not too far.
                                    Use Well on the group of five right before Kalli spawns in. When she does, pump as much damage into her as possible. When she teleports away, repeat
                                    at a different plate. Repeat as often as necessary. Extremely skilled fireteams can manage this in two spawns.
